                        Choose a good time to apologize. If your cat is visibly angry, you will need to give her some time before you try to approach her and apologize; approaching too soon may result in getting scratched. Try not to wait too long to apologize,
                        however; instead, approach the cat as soon as she appears calmer. You can also approach a frightened cat, but do so with caution. Refer to the section in this article on reading your cat's body language to learn how to determine your
                        cat's
                        mood.</p>

            <h3>1. Right Timing</h3>



            <ul>
                  <li>If your cat keeps running away from you, consider leaving behind a small treat in a place she can find. This will let her know that you are sorry and still care about her.</li>
                  <li>A frightened cat should be approached with care. Always give a frightened cat room to escape. She may actually need comfort and reassurance, especially if there was a loud, sudden sound. At the same time, however, she may want to be alone,
                        which is why leaving an escape route is so important. A frightened, cornered cat may quickly turn aggressive.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Talk to your cat</h3>

            <ul>
                  <li>Tell her "I'm sorry." You may even use your cat's name. Make sure that you are using a soft, calm voice, with a slightly higher pitch than usual. Your cat may not necessarily understand your words, but she will understand your tone. Do
                        not use a loud, shrill voice; cats do have sensitive hearing and you will only annoy your cat.</li>
            </ul>
