                        Choose a good time to apologize. If your cat is visibly angry, you will need to give her some time before you try to approach her and apologize; approaching too soon may result in getting scratched. Try not to wait too long to apologize,
                        however; instead, approach the cat as soon as she appears calmer. You can also approach a frightened cat, but do so with caution. Refer to the section in this article on reading your cat's body language to learn how to determine your
                        cat's
                        mood.</p>

                  <p>If you have been ignoring your cat lately, you may notice that your cat has become less affectionate than usual. This means that your cat could be upset and lonely. You can apologize to your cat by spending time with him. This could be as
                        simple as reading a book or listening to music next to your cat, or giving him a nice, long petting session. It could also mean that you have to set aside some time to play with your cat.</p>
                  <ul>
                        <li>If your cat keeps running away from you, consider leaving behind a small treat in a place she can find. This will let her know that you are sorry and still care about her.</li>
                        <li>A frightened cat should be approached with care. Always give a frightened cat room to escape. She may actually need comfort and reassurance, especially if there was a loud, sudden sound. At the same time, however, she may want to be
                              alone,
                              which is why leaving an escape route is so important. A frightened, cornered cat may quickly turn aggressive.</li>

                        <li>Tell her "I'm sorry." You may even use your cat's name. Make sure that you are using a soft, calm voice, with a slightly higher pitch than usual. Your cat may not necessarily understand your words, but she will understand your tone. Do
                              not use a loud, shrill voice; cats do have sensitive hearing and you will only annoy your cat.</li>

                  <p>It will tell you what sort of mood your cat is in. If your cat is too angry or upset, your apology will mean nothing to him or her and will most likely result in you getting slapped across the face. This section will show you how to read
                        your
                        cat's body language, so that you will know when it is safe to approach her.</p>
                  <ul>
                        <li>Watch their tails. It's a good indication of their moods.</li>
                        <li>If the tail is pointing up, with the tip slightly curled to the side, your cat is content and safe to approach.</li>
                        <li>If the tail is poofed up, your cat is frightened. You may try to approach your cat to calm him down, but do so slowly, and make sure that your cat can run and hide from you. A cornered cat may quickly turn into an aggressive cat.</li>

                  <img src="images/cat-5.jpg" alt="cat5" height="200" width="320">
                  <p>Your cat could be upset with you because you have not been spending enough time with him. If your cat is more energetic, you could consider playing with himâ€”although most cats would enjoy swatting at a piece of string. Here are some ways you
                        can play with your cat:</p>
                  <ul>
                        <li>Purchase a laser pointer and point the laser on a spot on the wall or the floor. Once your cat is paying attention to the red dot, move the laser around. He may even try running after the laser.</li>
                        <li>Toss a piece of crumpled up cellophane or paper towards your cat. You can also use a toy mouse instead. Do not throw the toy at him, however. Instead, aim for a spot just before his paws.</li>
                  </ul>
