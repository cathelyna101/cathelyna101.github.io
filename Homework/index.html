                        discovered and named during the 2019â€“20 coronavirus outbreak. Those affected may develop a fever, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. Cases can progress to pneumonia and
                        multi-organ failure. </p>

                              The virus is thought to spread mainly from person-to-person.</h4>

                        <p>These droplets can land in the mouths or noses of people who are nearby or possibly be inhaled into the lungs.</p>

                        <p>It may be possible that a person can get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it and then touching their own mouth, nose, or possibly their eyes, but this is not thought to be the main way the virus spreads.
