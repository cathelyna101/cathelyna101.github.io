                  <p class="g1-text">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS coronavirus 2 or SARS-CoV-2), a virus closely related to the SARS virus. The disease was
                        discovered and named during the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak. Those affected may develop a fever, dry cough, fatigue, and shortness of breath. A sore throat, runny nose or sneezing is less common. Cases can progress to pneumonia and
                        multi-organ failure. California announced its first coronavirus-linked death Wednesday, bringing the death toll in the United States to 11. The death, which occurred in Placer County in Northern California, is the first U.S. coronavirus
                        fatality to occur outside of Washington state, where a 10th death was confirmed Wednesday.</p>

                        <p>Gov. Gavin Newsom  declared a state of emergency in California, and he requested that a cruise ship be held off the coast after confirmation that a number of passengers and crew members aboard had developed symptoms consistent with
                        coronavirus disease.
                        Los Angeles County declared a local health emergency as officials confirmed six new cases of coronavirus there, and nine new cases were confirmed in New York. American workers face increasing disruptions to their routines as companies,
                        schools and local governments implement precautions to curb the outbreak, with many firms restricting travel or weighing work-from-home arrangements.
                        In China, the outbreak appeared to be easing. Far more new cases were reported outside the country than within, suggesting that Chinese authorities’ draconian efforts to curb transmission may be paying off at home, even as the casualty count
                        mounts elsewhere. The World Health Organization said Tuesday that covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, has killed about 3.4 percent of those diagnosed with the illness — a higher rate than experts previously estimated. </p>
