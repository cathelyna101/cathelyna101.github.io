            <h2 class="intro">An Indonesian tale</h2>
            <p class="intro">From a restaurant serving burgers and pizzas made with local noodles to a social media star giving street food a touch of haute cuisine, a new wave of innovative chefs are putting a modern twist on Indonesia’s traditional
                  fare.

                  New eateries have sprung up rapidly in recent years in the capital Jakarta offering a wide array of foreign foods to cater to a growing consumer class which has emerged after a long economic boom.

                  But rather than focus entirely on cuisine from overseas, some chefs decided to fuse the new influences with age-old Indonesian foods.</p>

            <h2>An Indonesian "Mentai" Rice: Rice On The Block</h2>
            <div class="mentaii">

                  <p class="para">The beginning of the creation of mentai sauce itself was inspired by Western food styles where mentaiko was combined with mayonnaise to produce a thick texture. The character tastes quite creamy, but there is a sense of umami
                        which is none
                        other than the egg of the kod aka mentaiko itself.

                        If explored further, the taste of original Japanese mentai sauce feels more bland because of minimal spices and only uses mayonnaise. Unlike in Indonesia, many mentai sauce sellers who modify the flavor with a variety of spices so that the
                        taste of mentai sauce is more easily accepted by the tongue of our society.</p>

                  <p class="para">The funny thing is, there are also many mentai sauce sellers who use tobiko as the main ingredient because cod farming is quite difficult to find in Indonesia. It tastes a little different, but it's still tasty. Rice on the
                        Block, is an
                        online food delivery service where we sell Indonesian mentai rice. It was established in the middle of the pandemic out of boredom, and is unexpectedly quite high in demand. The ingredients we use are of good quality, like the fresh Norwegian

                              Java as the place where the Indian kebab, imported by Muslim traders, first took on a distinctly more eastern flavour.</p>

                  <br>
                  <p class="para">In the 19th century, many Tamil and Gujarat Muslim traders came to Indonesia. The Indian traders brought processed grilled goat meat called kebab. At first, the Indonesian people cooked meat by boiling it. But after getting to
                        know kebab,
                        Indonesian people like to eat beef or mutton by burning it. The word satay is also thought to originate from the Tamil language, which is catai which means meat. Satay is also growing throughout Indonesia. Almost every region in Indonesia has
                        a unique satay menu. Satay also spread to the Straits of Malacca, Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand. Apparently in that century there were migrants from Java and Madura who sold satay there. At the end of the 19th century, satay spread to
                        South Africa. There, satay is called sosatie.</p>

                        <p class="para1">Gyudon is basically a dish of thinly sliced fatty beef, cooked in a slightly sweet mixture of mirin and soy sauce and served over rice. Sake is also sometimes added for extra flavor. At the place I went to in Beijing, the
                              would serve it
                              piping hot with a raw egg yolk on top. With thinly sliced beef and sweet onions over a bowl of steaming rice, this Gyudon (牛丼), or “beef bowl” is a mouthwatering Japanese classic that comes together in minutes. The secret to tender
                              flavorful beef is to gently simmer the meat in a broth made from dashi, white wine, and sake. The broth turns into a tasty sauce that percolates into the rice, flavoring each grain with loads of beefy goodness.
                              Although these days Japan is famous for their Wagyu beef, using cattle for food is a relatively new concept that dates back to the latter half of the 19th century, when Japan opened its doors to foreign trade. One of the first areas to
                              welcome foreigners was Tokyo, which is why it’s no big surprise that Gyudon got its start there.</p>

                        It would warm up as you mixed it in with the hot beef and rice, imparting a richness to the dish that couldn’t be beat––not even by the beckoning call of hand-pulled noodles or Yunnan hot pot. Needless to say, I frequented that particular
                        spot at least once every couple weeks.

                        Now that I’m back in the States, where elaborate weekday lunches aren’t quite as easy on my wallet as they were in Jakarta, I’ve been seeking to recreate some of my old favorites, and this Gyudon recipe is definitely one of them!</p>

                  <p class="para">My Gyudon however, uses Wagyu Steak instead of thinly sliced beef, and also Onsen Egg instead of raw egg. The combination is a heavenly match that everyone should try.</p>
